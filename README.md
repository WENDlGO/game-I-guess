# Just Some Info
I don't really know what I'm doing and am learning as I go, I know some python but have not really made anything before, I just thought it would be fun to make a game I could play with my friends. 

I know I want the game to focus dungeon exploration and have some more in depth systems but other than that I'm not really sure. I like playing For the King, but I don't like how little it's focused on being a party, if you get a good weapon you can solo basically everything and just ened up running around attacking everything you can see. I want my game to be more party focused and less every man for them selves. 

Iv also never made a repo in git before so idk what I'm doing and hoping I don't mess everything up. 

(This was made using pyxel, so if you want to try it you'll have to install pyxel for it to run.
I found it a while ago and thought it would be fun to make a retro style game, witch would focus more on it's own systems instead of graphics.)
